# M2R-Gillespie-algorithm-for-stochastic-biochemical-systems
# An implementations of the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) for a variety of biochemical reaction.
Case 1: Degradation

Case 2: Birthâ€“Death

Case 3: Protein complex formation

Case 4: ligand-mediated Dimerization 

Case 5: Gene expression

Here we first attempt the reference's way of degradation, and attempt some numbers which can apply on other Case. And make some Figures for each cases.
