# M2R-Gillespie-algorithm-for-stochastic-biochemical-systems
An implementations of the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) for a variety of biochemical reaction. Case 1: Degradation  Case 2: Birthâ€“Death  Case 3: Protein complex formation  Case 4: ligand-mediated Dimerization   Case 5: Gene expression  Here we first attempt the reference's way of degradation
